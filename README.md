# Etch-a-Sketch

![sketch](./images/etch-a-sketch.png)

This project is a basic emulation of the actual etch-a-sketch drawing tool. I created this project for the purpose of applying and understanding JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods and events. It is under the **_Foundations > JavaScript Basics_** course of The Odin Project curriculum. It has been a challenging yet fun experience. I really enjoyed this one so far.
